                            Song by
                            Seal
                            In a church, by the face he talks about the people goin' under
                            Only child know
                            A man decides after 70 years
                            That what he goes there for is to unlock the door
                            While those around him criticize and sleep
                            And through a fractal on a breaking wall
                            I see you my friend and touch your face again
                            Miracles will happen as we trip
                            But we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy
                            No, we're never gonna survive unless we are a little (crazy) crazy
                            Crazy yellow people walking through my head
                            One of them's got a gun, to shoot the other one
                            And yet together they were friends at school
                            (Oh, get it, get it, get it, get it, no, no)
                            If all were there when we first took the pill
                            Then maybe, then maybe, then maybe, then maybe
                            Miracles will happen as we speak
                            But we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy
                            No, we're never gonna survive unless we are a little crazy
                            No, no, never survive, unless we get a little bit...
                            Oh darlin', in a sky full of people, only some want to fly, isn't that crazy?
                            In a world full of people, only some want to fly, isn't that crazy, crazy?
                            In a heaven of people, there's only some want to fly, isn't that crazy?
                            Oh babe! (Oh darlin')
                            In a world full of people, there's only some want to fly, isn't that crazy?
                            (Isn't that crazy, isn't that crazy, isn't that crazy?)
                            Oh, but we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy
                            No, we're never gonna to survive unless we are a little (crazy)
